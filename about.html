  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>As engineers, we live in an incredible time. We have access almost unlimited computing power at our fingertips. We have an vibrant landscape of tools to help solve the challenges of provisioning and configuring servers, launching applications, and monitoring our infrastructure.  Companies are able to move faster than ever before to build and launch products.</p>
  <p>My hope for this project is to help document a conversation about DevOps in the real world. I want to learn how other teams, ideally small teams automate and manage their infrastructure. I plan to do this via a series of conversations with engineers currently involved in DevOps at their respected company. This site is a home for those talks and a place to start documenting the tools and techniques organizations use to automate the process of moving code from developer machines into production.<p>
